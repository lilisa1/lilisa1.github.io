            Rugby 7’s is a 7-a-side game made up of 7 players playing 7 minute halves
            (can you tell where they got the name?). It is a variant of Rugby Union of 
            the usual 15 players playing 40 minute halves (whoever decided 80 minute 
            rugby games was a good idea is mentally insane). 
            <br>
            <br>
            With only 14 players on a regulation sized Soccer field and 14 minutes to win, 
            this form of the sport is essentially a giant game of tag where you can also 
            hit the living s*** out of another player.

            Due to the pure entertainment value of the sport and its recent re-inclusion 
            into the Olympic games, according to a Nielsen report, 
            Rugby is officially the fastest growing sport in the United States,
            with women leading the way.

            10 years ago, it would have been rare for a girl to even touch a rugby ball 
            before college. Now, some of the best female players around the world were born 
            in 2000!?! 
        
            Regardless of the current playing field, the leading pack of national 
            players we see today who have paved the way for the future of women’s rugby 
            started in uni. Some by choice, some by chance. Therefore, I thought it would 
            be interesting to show a map displaying their roots!
