            <span id="question">What is Rugby 7's?</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Rugby 7’s is a 7-a-side game made up of 7 players playing 7 minute halves
            (can you tell where they got the name?). It is a variant of Rugby Union of 
            the usual 15 players playing 40 minute halves. 
            With only 14 players on an open field and 14 minutes to win, 
            this sport requires, to a greater or lesser degree, the physicality of judo,  
            the athleticism of the 400m dash, 
            the aggression of sprint cycling, and the endurance of rowing. 
            It is Tokyo drift style fast and funky and fun.

            <span id="question">Why This Topic?</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to the pure entertainment value of the sport and its recent re-inclusion 
            into the Olympic games, according to a Nielsen report, 
            Rugby is officially the fastest growing sport in the United States,
            with women leading the way. 
            <br>
            <br>

            Not long ago, it was rare for a girl to even touch a rugby ball 
            before college. Now, there are Gen-Z Olympians!
            Regardless of the current field of competition, many of the leading pack of national 
            players we see today who have paved the way for the future of women’s rugby, 
            started in College. Some by purposely, and some by chance. 
            Each following their own unique path. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, I thought it would 
            be interesting to show a map tracing their Rugby journey.
